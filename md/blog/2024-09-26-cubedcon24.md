Get ready! This year, we're excited to be participating in CubedCon with our first-ever booth!

## ❓ What is it?
CubedCon is a Minecraft convention that takes place on a Minecraft server. Anyone can attend to enjoy the full convention experience, including exploring booths, watching panels, and participating in games and other activities.

The entire event is in support of the charity [SpecialEffect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk), an organization that helps people with disabilities enjoy video games.

## 📅 When is it?
From `October 4, 2024 at 6:00 pm UTC` until `October 6, 2024`

## 💻 How do I join?
First, make sure to visit [CubedCon Tickets](https://cubedcon.com/tickets) to claim your **free** ticket. This is important, as you'll be unable to join the event without signing up. Once the event begins, you'll be able to join via `play.cubedcon.com`

## 🎁 A special surprise!?
