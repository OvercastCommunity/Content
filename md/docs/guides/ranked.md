## Registration

## Playing

# Ranking system

## Spark Rating

Our exclusive ranking system, known as **Spark Rating**, plays a pivotal role in assessing your performance. This unique rating, with a range between **0 and 5000**, remains hidden until you have participated in at least 30 matches. Ratings above `3000` will start decaying at a rate of **-10 Spark Rating** per day after not having played for 3 days.

## Ranks

You will start being **Unranked**. Once you play 15 matches, you will be awarded a provisional rank. Upon reaching 30 matches played, your rank will be tied to your Spark Rating.

There are 6 rank divisions: **Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold**, **Platinum**, **Diamond** and **Master**, each one being divided into 5 subdivisions (e.g. Silver 2). On top of them there is **Grandmaster**, which is the highest rank one can achieve.
